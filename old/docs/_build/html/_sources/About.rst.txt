This is a typical paragraph.  An indented literal block follows.

::

    for a in [5,4,3,2,1]:   # this is program code, shown as-is
        print a
    print "it's..."
    # a literal block continues until the indentation ends

This text has returned to the indentation of the first paragraph,
is outside of the literal block, and is therefore treated as an
ordinary paragraph.

:what: Field lists map field names to field bodies, like
    database records.  They are often part of an extension
    syntax.

:how: The field marker is a colon, the field name, and a
      colon.

      The field body may contain one or more body elements,
      indented relative to the field marker.
